# Image-Magnifier

Instead of having the magnified image following the cursor, I decided to have it projected in the top left hand corner. The issue I've encountered however, is that I was unable to actually get the image to expand. I wanted to use the mouseDragged() function so that when the cursor is dragged upwards, the projected image in the square would magnify. I was unable to do this and only got as far as I did because my laptop kept crashing so I was unable to proceed.
